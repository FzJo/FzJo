### **Seriousness** and a lot of The Office(US) humor characterize me

While at first glance my career journey seem unrelated each experience is connected to progress related to my core values : pedagogy, personal questioning and a balance of rigor and creativity. My curiosity and dedication to growth have been a key factor in both the formal and self taught education I have consistently pursued over the past decade. 
I aspire to work for a company with strong values ​​and to develop applications that have a positive impact on people.
